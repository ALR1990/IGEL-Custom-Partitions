# IGEL-Custom-Partitions
The IGEL OS is a Linux operating system based on the Ubuntu Linux distribution, but using a mainline kernel for maximum hardware compatibility and flexibility. Properly deployed, IGEL OS is locked down to the configurations and applications defined via UMS Profiles. The Custom Partitions feature allows you to implement custom scripts, apps, or other files to one or a group of devices running the IGEL OS.â€‹ Typical use-cases might include deploying Google Chrome, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or a Linux version of a line of business application. As an example, IGEL has a retail industry customer who installs their POS software directly to the IGEL OS resulting in a fully centralized solution for implementing and maintaining their devices anywhere, quickly. Everything runs locally.
